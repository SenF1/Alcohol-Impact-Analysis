# Alcohol's Influence on Student Performance

An comprehensive analysis of the influence of alcohol consumption on student performance. The analysis investigates how alcohol consumption patterns, both during the week and on weekends, affect students' performance in mathematics.

## Project Description
An R-based analysis project for the course Economics and Data Science (73-265) at Carnegie Mellon University. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between alcohol consumption and high school students' academic performance. 

Focusing on Portuguese high school students, the project explores how personal factors, including average test grades, intersect with alcohol consumption habits. By examining variables such as sex, age, and parent occupation/education, we investigate the specific influence of alcohol on math examination performance, differentiating between weekday and weekend consumption.
